    <h1>Summary</h1>
    
    <p>Computer scientist with a passion for distributed systems, interesting algorithms, and
    developing the kinds of tools that allow people to find the data they're looking for,
    and then put the data to use solving practical, real-world problems.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I relish working with truly large data sets, learning new languages, and applying them
    to both work and personal projects. Work experience to date includes some of the world's
    largest infrastructures, in a variety of computing roles and contexts.</p>

            Redesigned how Apache Spark and Apache Avro work together to allow 
            developers to more easily process data. Along that way I implemented 
            several performance increases in Spark yielding up to 70% reduction 
            in network usage. Worked on integrating the project into Cloudera's 
            own Hadoop distribution.

    <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
    <strong>Raft Implementation in Scala</strong>
    <p>
      Wrote an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Scala. It supports 
      leader election, adding and removing nodes, and has strong consistency 
      guarantees. This project was written is such a way that it could be extended
      to a magnitude of use cases. To prove this, I created a robust key-value 
      database on top of the consensus protocol to demonstrate how it could be 
      used. This project also includes Jepsen tests to prove that the implementation
      is correct and that it will not lose any data, even in the face of major network 
      partitions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Gossip-Based CRDT</strong>
    <p>
      Constructed a distributed backend counting service that was capable of withstanding
      large amounts of requests. This was achieved by using CRDTs in the background to pass
      around state to all other nodes in the service. This was built using a combination
      of lightweight threads for the request handling, Apache Zookeeper as the coordination
      system, and Apache thrift as the shared communication protocol.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Wikipedia Page Views Analytics</strong>
    <p>
      Using HDFS and HBase, built a system that processed and stored the page view 
      log data for all of Wikipedia and presented the information in a real-time web 
      UI. Personally setup and maintained an 8 node Hadoop cluster for the project.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Github Language Analyzer</strong>
    <p>
      Built a data analyzer and ingest pipeline using Go to determine the programming 
      language usage across all of GitHub. This provided key insights to language usage
      trends over time and in comparison to each other. Implemented a distributed ingest 
      pipeline to increase processing capabilities.
