    I love working with truly <strong>large datasets</strong>, learning new
    <strong>languages</strong>, and applying them to both work and personal
    projects. Work experience to date includes some of the world's largest
    <strong>infrastructures</strong>, in a variety of computing roles and
    contexts.
