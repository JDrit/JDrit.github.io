    <strong>Raft Implementation in Scala</strong>
    <p>
      Wrote an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Scala. It supported
      leader election, adding and removing nodes, and had strong consistency
      guarantees. The project was implemented in an abstract way such that it could
      be extended to be used for a magnitude of use cases. I created a robust key-value
      store to demostrate how it could be used. Wrote Jepsen test to prove that the 
      implementation was correct and would not lose data, even in the face of major 
      network partitions

    <strong>Wikipedia Page Views Analytics</strong>
    <p>
      Using HDFS and HBase, built a system that processed and stored the page view 
      log data for all of Wikipedia and presented the information in a real-time web 
      UI. Personally setup and maintained an 8 node Hadoop cluster for the project.

    <strong>Github Language Analyzer</strong>
    <p>
      Built a data analyzer and ingest pipeline using Go to determine the programming 
      language usage across all of GitHub. This provided key insights to language usage
      trends over time and in comparison to each other. Implemented a distributed ingest 
      pipeline to increase processing capabilities.
